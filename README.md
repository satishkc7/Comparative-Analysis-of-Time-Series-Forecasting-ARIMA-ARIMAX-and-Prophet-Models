Gold Price and Bitcoin Forecasting Using Time Series Models
            This project uses historical data and exogenous variables, including Bitcoin, to forecast gold prices. The goal is to predict future gold prices using various time series models and compare their performance. The models used include ARIMA, ARIMAX (with Bitcoin as an exogenous variable), and Prophet. The project showcases how different forecasting techniques perform and highlights the importance of error metrics in evaluating model accuracy.

Project Overview:
    This project leverages financial data to forecast gold prices and analyze the impact of Bitcoin on gold price movements. The primary focus is on evaluating the performance of ARIMA, ARIMAX, and Prophet models, using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error).

Key Features:
Historical Data: Gold price data (GC=F) and Bitcoin price data (BTC-USD) from Yahoo Finance.
Time Series Models: ARIMA, ARIMAX (with Bitcoin), and Prophet for forecasting.
Evaluation Metrics: RMSE and MAPE to assess model performance.
Insights: Understanding the discrepancies between RMSE and MAPE and how they impact model evaluation.
